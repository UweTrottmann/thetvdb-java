The TVDB API wrapper in Java written using retrofit.

Currently supported [The TVDB API](https://api.thetvdb.com/swagger) version: `2.1.0`.

Currently in development, many endpoints are still incomplete, pull requests are welcome.

## Usage
Get via Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.uwetrottmann.thetvdb-java:thetvdb-java:1.2.0'
```

Or Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.uwetrottmann.thetvdb-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>thetvdb-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Use like any other retrofit2 based service. Automatically gets a JSON web token so you only need to supply your API key.
For example:

```java
TheTvdb theTvdb = new TheTvdb(API_KEY);
retrofit2.Response<SeriesWrapper> response = getTheTvdb().series()
    .series(83462, "en")
    .execute();
if (response.isSuccessful()) {
    Series series = response.body().data;
    System.out.println(series.seriesName + " is awesome!");
}

```
